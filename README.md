# GSEA_Analysis
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identifies if a predefined set of genes, such as those linked to a GO term or KEGG pathway, shows significant differences between two biological states. This R Notebook demonstrates GSEA using the clusterProfiler package with Drosophila organism data for analysis and visualization.
